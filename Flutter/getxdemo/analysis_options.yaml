# This file configures the analyzer, which statically analyzes Dart code to
# check for errors, warnings, and lints.
#
# The issues identified by the analyzer are surfaced in the UI of Dart-enabled
# IDEs (https://dart.dev/tools#ides-and-editors). The analyzer can also be
# invoked from the command line by running `flutter analyze`.

# The following line activates a set of recommended lints for Flutter apps,
# packages, and plugins designed to encourage good coding practices.
include: package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml

linter:
  # The lint rules applied to this project can be customized in the
  # section below to disable rules from the `package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml`
  # included above or to enable additional rules. A list of all available lints
  # and their documentation is published at
  # https://dart-lang.github.io/linter/lints/index.html.
  #
  # Instead of disabling a lint rule for the entire project in the
  # section below, it can also be suppressed for a single line of code
  # or a specific dart file by using the `// ignore: name_of_lint` and
  # `// ignore_for_file: name_of_lint` syntax on the line or in the file
  # producing the lint.
  rules:
    # avoid_print: false  # Uncomment to disable the `avoid_print` rule
    # prefer_single_quotes: true  # Uncomment to enable the `prefer_single_quotes` rule

#================================LintNorm===================
## This file configures the analyzer to use the lint rule set from `package:lint`
#
## For apps, use the default set
#include: package:lint/analysis_options.yaml
#
## Packages, that may be distributed (i.e. via pub.dev) should use the package
## version, resulting in a better pub score.
## include: package:lint/analysis_options_package.yaml
#
## You might want to exclude auto-generated files from dart analysis
#analyzer:
#  exclude:
#  #- '**.freezed.dart'
#
## You can customize the lint rules set to your own liking. A list of all rules
## can be found at https://dart-lang.github.io/linter/lints/options/options.html
